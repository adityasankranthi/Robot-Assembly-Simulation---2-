# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 2

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

#### What is this homework assignment about?

This homework assignment is about implementing a class that represents a robot with sequence capabilities from the textbook. The class must follow certain invariants and implement various methods for manipulating sequences of Part objects.

### Gather

#### What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new?
I may need to review concepts related to dynamic arrays, invariants, assertions and also read chapter 3 before starting the homework. 

### Brainstorm

#### What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment?
before writing any method It would be best to draw a pictorial representation of how the method works, maybe pick up a test case and understand how it works and then try to code with paying attention to exceptions and assertions. 

### Plan

#### What will I work on first after I finish this planning part?
1. start by implementing the constructor and making sure that the invariants are maintained.
2. implement methods for adding, removing, and accessing parts in the sequence. pay attention to addBefore and addAfter (the conditions when there is no current element).
3. pay attention to remove method to make sure that no index in the dynamic array is null.
4. implement methods for navigating through the sequence by completing all the TODOs


*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*
